*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

## About The Project

<h3> About the project</h3>
<hr>

<p>The point was to make an interface that did stuff. I had just learned to code and was 14 years old at most. (I am 20 now).
Please do not expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated code</li>
<li>An easy-to-read code</li>
<li>A good code</li>
<li> everything to work smoothly in the most efficient way</li>
<li> To be in english. It is in spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I did use jQuery, but nothing else.
The most current version that I have will be uploaded to main, while the previous ones will be uploaded to another branch that will be named "Previous versions".
I will accept pull requests but never to one of those two branches. If someone does want to contribute (which would be an honor), it will be sent to another branch.
